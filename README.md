## Introduction

- ICMP is defined in [**RFC 792**](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc792.html).
- ICMP (**Internet Control Message Protocol**) is the utility protocol of TCP/IP responsible for providing information regarding the availability of devices, services, or routes in a TCP/IP network.

### ICMP Type Number

### ICMP Structure

- **Type**: It's an 8-bit field. It defines the ICMP message type. The values range from 0 to 127 are defined for ICMPv6, and the values from 128 to 255 are the informational messages.
- **Code**: It's an 8-bit field that defines the subtype of the ICMP message
- **Checksum**: It's a 16-bit field to detect whether the error exists in the message or not.

## Security

- ICMP Attacks against TCP ~ [**RFC 5927**](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5927)
- Administrators face the challenge of balancing ICMP usage for network operations against potential risks. Key security concerns include:

### 1. Footprinting
- ICMP is exploited for footprinting, gathering information about targets.
- [‚öîÔ∏è] Ping sweeps identify live hosts, and router discovery is achieved using Solicitation messages.
- [üõ°Ô∏è] Blocking ICMP entirely hinders footprinting but complicates troubleshooting. A compromise is to block ICMP from untrusted networks.

### 2. Denial of Service (DoS)
- Unreachable messages can be spoofed to trick hosts into closing connections.
- [‚öîÔ∏è] Smurf Attacks flood a target with Echo packets, overwhelming it.
- [‚öîÔ∏è] The Ping of Death, an older threat, involves creating large fragmented packets to crash systems.
- [üõ°Ô∏è] Firewalls with ICMP rate-limiting features help mitigate these attacks.

### 3. Tunneling
- ICMP echo and echo-reply packets can be used for covert channeling.
- [‚öîÔ∏è] Tunneling encapsulates restricted data within seemingly ordinary traffic.
- [üõ°Ô∏è] Mitigation involves using application firewalls or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) with deep packet inspection.

### 4. Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attacks
- [‚öîÔ∏è] ICMP redirects can be spoofed, leading hosts to use compromised routers as gateways.
- [‚öîÔ∏è] MITM attacks involve intercepting and potentially altering legitimate traffic.

- Balancing the benefits of ICMP with robust security measures is crucial for administrators to ensure network integrity and resilience against potential threats.

## Tools

- To better comprehend certain concepts and facilitate specific activities, I've developed some tools in **C#** and **PowerShell** to enhance the understanding of **Ping Sweep** and **ICMP Exfiltration**.

### [Psweep](https://github.com/h0ru/icmp-quickhacks/tree/main/psweep) ~ Cross-platform Ping Sweep utility developed in C# and available in .NET 4.0 and 6.0.
### [ICMP-Exfil](https://github.com/h0ru/icmp-quickhacks/tree/main/icmp-exfil) ~ ICMP Exfiltration tool available in .NET 4.0 and PowerShell
